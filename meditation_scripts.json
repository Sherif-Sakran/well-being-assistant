        "purpose": "To calm the nervous system and create a feeling of safety when experiencing anxiety.",
        "script": [
        "Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. If it feels right, place one hand on your heart and the other on your stomach.",
        "Gently close your eyes and bring your awareness to the points of contact between your body and the chair or floor. Feel yourself supported, held by the ground beneath you.",
        "Now, bring your attention to your breath. There's no need to change anything; just notice it. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your hands with each breath.",
        "Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, counting silently to four.",
        "And a slow, steady exhale out through your mouth, counting silently to six.",
        "This longer exhale helps to soothe the nervous system. Let's do that a few more times. Inhale for four... and exhale for six.",
        "Imagine each exhale is a gentle wave washing over you, carrying away a little bit of the worry. With each breath, you are a little more calm, a little more settled.",
        "You are safe here. You can rest. Let your breath return to its natural pace, knowing that you are grounded and supported."

        "purpose": "To relax the body and quiet the mind, preparing it for a deep and restorative sleep.",
        "script": [
        "Lie down on your back, getting as comfortable as possible. Let your body feel heavy and fully supported by the bed. Gently close your eyes.",
        "Bring your awareness to your feet. Feel them relax completely, all the way to your toes.",
        "Now, let that feeling of relaxation move up your body. Your ankles, your calves, your knees. Each part of you is softening, letting go.",
        "Feel the relaxation move into your hips and your stomach. Your back is supported and resting deeply. Your shoulders are sinking into the mattress.",
        "Let go of all the tension in your hands and arms. And finally, feel the muscles in your face soften. Your jaw is loose, your forehead is smooth. Let a sense of peace settle over your entire being.",
        "Now, bring your attention to your breath. Imagine a gentle rhythm of breathing, like a soft lullaby. Inhale peace, exhale all thoughts of the day.",
        "Allow your mind to drift. If a thought comes, simply notice it and let it float away, like a cloud in the sky. There is nothing left to do. Nothing to hold onto.",
        "You are safe to rest. You can let go completely. Welcome the peaceful passage into sleep."

        "purpose": "To sharpen concentration and improve mental clarity by training the mind to return to a single point of focus.",
        "script": [
        "Take a comfortable, upright seat. Sit with your spine straight but not stiff. Your hands can rest gently on your knees or in your lap. Soften your gaze or close your eyes.",
        "Begin by taking a few deep, cleansing breaths. Inhale through your nose, and exhale with a soft sigh out of your mouth, letting go of any distractions you've brought with you.",
        "Now, bring your full attention to the sensation of your breath. Notice where you feel it mostâ€”perhaps the air entering and leaving your nostrils, or the rise and fall of your chest or belly.",
        "Your mind will wander. This is completely natural. When you notice your mind has drifted, gently and without judgment, guide your attention back to the sensation of your breath. Think of it as a gentle muscle you are training.",
        "Each time you bring your attention back, you are building your capacity for focus. It's not about being perfect; it's simply about the practice of returning.",
        "Stay with the breath for a few more moments. Let it be the anchor that keeps you in the present, a clear and steady point of focus.",
        "Before you open your eyes, take a moment to notice how you feel. Carry this sense of clarity with you into the rest of your day."

        "script": [
        "Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Gently close your eyes and place one hand over your heart.",
        "Take a few deep breaths, feeling the warmth of your hand against your chest. This is a simple gesture of kindness, a moment of acknowledgment just for you.",
        "Now, bring to mind a recent time when you may have struggled or felt a sense of pain, failure, or disappointment. This doesn't have to be a big moment; just a small one will do.",
        "As you remember this feeling, notice where it lives in your body. Instead of pushing it away, can you gently make space for it? Acknowledge it with kindness, as you would a friend in need.",
        "Now, repeat these phrases softly to yourself, either out loud or in your mind: 'This is a moment of suffering. Suffering is a part of life. May I be kind to myself in this moment.'",
        "Notice how it feels to speak these words to yourself. You are not trying to fix anything; you are simply offering a moment of understanding. Just like everyone else, you deserve kindness, especially from yourself.",
        "Rest in this feeling of gentle self-acceptance for a few more breaths. With your hand still on your heart, know that you can always return to this place of comfort and compassion."

        "purpose": "To mindfully observe feelings of anger without judgment and to release their physical and emotional grip.",
        "script": [
        "Find a comfortable and private place to sit. Sit with a straight, grounded posture, as if you are a steady mountain. Gently close your eyes.",
        "Bring your awareness to your breath, but this time, don't try to change it. Just let it be. Notice if it feels fast or shallow, without needing to fix it.",
        "Now, allow yourself to bring to mind the feeling of anger. You don't need to relive the event, just notice the feeling itself. Where do you feel it in your body? Is it a tightness in your jaw, a heat in your chest, or a knot in your stomach?",
        "Instead of reacting to the anger, imagine you are a calm, steady observer, like a scientist. Just watch the sensation. It's just a feeling, and feelings come and go, like weather passing over a mountain.",
        "Take a slow, intentional exhale. Imagine you are gently breathing through the feeling. Not pushing it away, but simply letting it soften and lose some of its intensity with each breath out.",
        "Repeat this several times, breathing into the anger and gently letting it go on the exhale. You are in control. You are the mountain, and the anger is the weather.",
        "Continue to sit with a sense of groundedness and calm. You have the power to observe your feelings without being overwhelmed by them."
